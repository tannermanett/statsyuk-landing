            We've recently added a new feature to our sidebar - the Salary Info. This feature provides a breakdown of a player's salary, including their cap hit, any clauses in their contract, and a detailed breakdown of their base salary over the years. 
            We also recently added the Standings table, and have many more updates coming to it soon! Check it out to see how your team ranks in stats like Goal Differential, Point Percentage, and many more insightful stats.
